# Simple_Math_Game

- This is my third project called *Math Game*.
- It is a simple mathematical game with a graphical user interface (GUI).
- In this game, you will be given five problems to solve.
- The problem set includes addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and modulus operations.
-  At the end of the game, you will see your score and the time taken to solve the five problems.
